```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a test. 

```
# provide some descriptive statistics
summary(cars)

# plot a 2 axis graph
plot(cars)

The average speed of the dataset is equal to `r mean(cars$speed)` mile per hour.

$y_i= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1.x_1+\alpha_2.x_2+\alpha_3.x_3+\epsilon$

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
